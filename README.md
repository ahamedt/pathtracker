A simple path tracking app. Users can create an account, and then look at the various paths that they have taken thus far. In addition, they are able to record the path that they take via the Record functionality. PennApps personal project.

NOTE: Free version of ngrok was used to make the base URL connective, which needs replacing every 8 hrs after use. The server files, which are not yet in the repo, are also required to run the app.
